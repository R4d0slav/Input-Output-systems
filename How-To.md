**How-To**

To initiate the challenge click on the rightmost button. The green led will blink and 3 random sounds are gonna be played.
When the challenge finishes, the green led will blink again, indicating the end of the challenge.
Now you try to guess the sounds played by the challenge and when you click on 3 buttons (play 3 sounds), you will be shown whether you are "Correct" or "Incorrect".
Then click again on the rightmost button to reset everything and start the challenge again.

You can also play the piano without the challenge. Simply do not click the rightmost button.
